Neurotrauma is one of the only things that can deal direct damage to your health. Neurotrauma is extremely dangerous and can build up very quickly, and upon reaching 200%, will instantly kill the player. The brain will heal at a rate of 0.1% per second, assuming that the config is unchanged and nothing is damaging it.

## Caused by:

- [Stroke](Stroke.md)
- [Liver Damage](../Torso/Liver%20Damage.md) (80% or more, point at which it outpaces natural regeneration)
- [Kidney Damage](../Torso/Kidney%20Damage.md) (cancels out natural kidney regeneration at 100%)
- [Sepsis](../Blood/Sepsis.md) (25% or more, point at which it outpaces natural regeneration)
- [Hypoxemia](../Blood/Hypoxemia.md) (10% or more, point at which it outpaces natural regeneration)
- Using a [Tourniquet](../Items/Tourniquet.md)  on the head
- [Methamphetamine](../Items/Methamphetamine.md)
- [Hyperzine](../Items/Hyperzine.md)
- [Traumatic Shock](../Surgery/Traumatic%20Shock.md) (equal to strength divided by 100 per second, 10% or more is the point at which it outpaces natural regeneration)
- [Cyanide Poisoning](../Torso/Cyanide%20Poisoning.md)  (70% or more)
- [Gunshot wound]([Open Wounds](../Any%20bodypart/Open%20Wounds.md) "â€Œ"), chance when inflicted on head

Additionally, skull [Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md) prevent the natural regeneration of neurotrauma.

## Effects:

- Direct damage to vitality
- Instant death (at 200%)
- [Respiratory Arrest](../Lungs/Respiratory%20Arrest.md) (at 100% or more)
- [Unconsciousness](Unconsciousness.md) (at 100% or more)

## Treatments:

- Treating the causes
- [Mannitol](../Items/Mannitol.md)
