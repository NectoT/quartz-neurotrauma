Neurotrauma is one of the only things that can deal direct damage to your health. Neurotrauma is extremely dangerous and can build up very quickly, and upon reaching 200%, will instantly kill the player. The brain will heal at a rate of 0.1% per second, assuming that the config is unchanged and nothing is damaging it.

- [[Kidney Damage](../Torso/Kidney%20Damage.md)]([Kidney Damage](../Torso/Kidney%20Damage.md) "smartCard-inline") (cancels out natural kidney regeneration at 100%)
- [[Sepsis](../Blood/Sepsis.md)]([Sepsis](../Blood/Sepsis.md) "smartCard-inline") (25% or more, point at which it outpaces natural regeneration)
- [[Hypoxemia](../Blood/Hypoxemia.md)]([Hypoxemia](../Blood/Hypoxemia.md) "smartCard-inline") (10% or more, point at which it outpaces natural regeneration)
- Using a [[Tourniquet](../Items/Tourniquet.md)]([Tourniquet](../Items/Tourniquet.md) "smartCard-inline")  on the head

- [[Cyanide Poisoning](../Torso/Cyanide%20Poisoning.md)]([Cyanide Poisoning](../Torso/Cyanide%20Poisoning.md) "smartCard-inline")  (70% or more)
- [Gunshot wound]([Open Wounds](../Any%20bodypart/Open%20Wounds.md) "â€Œ"), chance when inflicted on head

## Effects:

- Direct damage to vitality

- Treating the causes

### ----------------------------------------

idk where to put but wheres carotid artery bleed

### ----------------------------------------

@sylviespider its in the generic [[Arterial Bleeding](../Extremities/Arterial%20Bleeding.md)]([Arterial Bleeding](../Extremities/Arterial%20Bleeding.md) "smartCard-inline") card since it works the same as other arterial bleeds except for not being able to use tourniquet

### ----------------------------------------

ahhh okay i feel like it should have more of a desription because i saw it forthe first time and panicked a little cause i thought it was somehting like aortic artery. i mean it is all the same im just kind of stupid

### ----------------------------------------

@sylviespider i moved the card to the extremities category and added a little more clarification in its description
