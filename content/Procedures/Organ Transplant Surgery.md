(if Organ Rejection is turned on in the `neurotrauma` config): Make sure to use [Azathioprine](../Items/Azathioprine.md) before placing the organ in, and make sure their immunity is 10% or lower. If organ damage is 100% after placing it in, that means it got rejected.

## Steps:

1. Anesthetic of your choice ([Analgesia](../Torso/Analgesia.md)
2. [Scalpel](../Items/Scalpel.md), on the torso
3. [Hemostat](../Items/Hemostat.md), on the torso
4. [Skin Retractors](../Items/Skin%20Retractors.md), on the torso
5. [Multipurpose Scalpel](../Items/Multipurpose%20Scalpel.md)
