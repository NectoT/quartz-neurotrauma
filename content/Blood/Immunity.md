Immunity helps fight [Infected Wounds](../Any%20bodypart/Infected%20Wounds.md) and increases natural healing. If your immunity is 6% or lower, you can use incompatible blood types without triggering [Hemotransfusion Shock](Hemotransfusion%20Shock.md). Immunity must be below 10% to safely transplant organs if you have organ rejection turned on in the config menu.
