Hypoxemia is the absence of adequate oxygen in the bloodstream. Hypoxemia can quickly build up and cause the patient to spiral out of control. A patient suffering from this needs immediate medical care. [Pneumothorax](../Lungs/Pneumothorax.md) will prevent Hypoxemia from going down, proportional to its strength.

## Caused by:

- [Cyanide Poisoning](../Torso/Cyanide%20Poisoning.md)
- [Cardiac Arrest](../Heart/Cardiac%20Arrest.md)
- [Oxygen Low](../Lungs/Oxygen%20Low.md)
- [Blood Loss](Blood%20Loss.md) (40% or more)
- [Hypotension](Hypotension.md) (70% or less)
- [Cyanide Poisoning](../Torso/Cyanide%20Poisoning.md) (10% or more)

## Effects:

- [Fibrillation](../Heart/Fibrillation.md)
- [Liver Damage](../Torso/Liver%20Damage.md) (at 4% or more, point at which it outpaces natural regeneration)
- [Heart Damage](../Heart/Heart%20Damage.md) (at 4% or more, point at which it outpaces natural regeneration)
- [Lung Damage](../Lungs/Lung%20Damage.md) (at 4% or more, point at which it outpaces natural regeneration)
- [Kidney Damage](../Torso/Kidney%20Damage.md) (at 8% or more, point at which it outpaces natural regeneration, 4% if one kidney is dead)
- [Hyperventilation](../Lungs/Hyperventilation.md) (at 10% or more)
- [Neurotrauma](../Head_Brain/Neurotrauma.md) (at 10% or more, point at which it outpaces natural regeneration)

- [Headache](../Symptoms/Headache.md) (at 40% or more)
- [Confusion](../Symptoms/Confusion%201.md) (at 50% or more)
- [Respiratory Arrest](../Lungs/Respiratory%20Arrest.md) (at 70% or more)
- [Cardiac Arrest](../Heart/Cardiac%20Arrest.md) (at 80% or more)
- [Unconsciousness](../Head_Brain/Unconsciousness.md) (at 80% or more)
- [Bone Damage](../Bones/Bone%20Damage.md) (cancels out natural bone regeneration at 100%)
