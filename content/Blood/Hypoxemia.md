Hypoxemia is the absence of adequate oxygen in the bloodstream. Hypoxemia can quickly build up and cause the patient to spiral out of control. A patient suffering from this needs immediate medical care. [Pneumothorax](../Lungs/Pneumothorax.md) will prevent Hypoxemia from going down, proportional to its strength.
