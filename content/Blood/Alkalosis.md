Alkalosis is usually ignorable, and minimal action is required at low to medium severity. Alkalosis and [Acidosis](Acidosis.md) will cancel each other out.

## Caused by:

- [Hyperventilation](../Lungs/Hyperventilation.md)
- [Vomiting](../Symptoms/Vomiting.md)
- [Blood Packs](../Items/Blood%20Packs.md) who's donor had alkalosis (alkalosis gained will be the donor's alkalosis level at time of extraction divided by 5)

## Effects:

- [Seizure](../Head_Brain/Seizure.md) (at 60% or more)
- [Palpitations](../Symptoms/Palpitations.md) (at 20% or more)

## Treatments:

- Treating the causes
- Inducing [Acidosis](Acidosis.md) (preferably with [Saline](../Items/Saline.md)
- Transfusing neutral [Blood Packs](../Items/Blood%20Packs.md) (unless the patient has 0% blood loss)
