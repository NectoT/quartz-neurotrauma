This mechanic is off by default. It can be toggled in the modâ€™s config, found in the ESC menu while the mod is enabled.

Organ rejection may occur when a patient receives an organ transplant while their [[Immunity](Immunity.md)]([Immunity](Immunity.md) "smartCard-inline") is higher than 10%. If organ rejection occurs, the organ that was transplanted will immediately gain 100% damage, making it useless.

Reducing [[Immunity](Immunity.md)]([Immunity](Immunity.md) "smartCard-inline") is primarily done using [[Azathioprine](../Items/Azathioprine.md)]([Azathioprine](../Items/Azathioprine.md) "smartCard-inline").

At 100% [[Immunity](Immunity.md)]([Immunity](Immunity.md) "smartCard-inline"), the chance for organ rejection is 60%. The formula, where 1 is 100%, is as follows:
