Acidosis is usually ignorable, and minimal action is required at low to medium severity. Acidosis and [Alkalosis](Alkalosis.md) will cancel each other out.

- [Respiratory Arrest](../Lungs/Respiratory%20Arrest.md)
- [Cardiac Arrest](../Heart/Cardiac%20Arrest.md)
- [Kidney Damage](../Torso/Kidney%20Damage.md) (80% or more)
- [Blood Packs](../Items/Blood%20Packs.md) who's donor had acidosis (acidosis gained will be the donor's acidosis level at time of extraction divided by 5)
