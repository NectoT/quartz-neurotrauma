The https://barotraumagame.com/wiki/Damage_(Affliction_Type) that a person may receive is divided into two groups based on their properties, [Open Wounds](Open%20Wounds.md) and internal wounds.

All internal wounds do not cause [Infected Wounds](Infected%20Wounds.md).

## Blunt force trauma:

This type of wound is typically not associated with bleeding, but may still cause life-threatening afflictions if it is a strong hit. Does not naturally regenerate past 100 strength.

### Causes:

- Falling, being knocked into a wall
- Crushed by a submarine
- Blunt weapons, such as a https://barotraumagame.com/wiki/Crowbar

### Effects:

- Vitality loss, proportional to damage taken
- [Dislocations](../Bones/Dislocations.md), after taking at least 2 damage
- Arm and leg [Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md), >2 damage
- Skull [Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md), >15 damage, at least 70% chance
- Neck [Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md), >15 damage
- Rib [Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md)
- Organ damage or [Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md), random range between 0 and damage taken
- [Pneumothorax](../Lungs/Pneumothorax.md), >5 damage
- [Concussion](../Head_Brain/Concussion.md), >15 damage, at least 70% chance
- [Traumatic Amputation](../Extremities/Traumatic%20Amputation.md), >15 damage and there is a fracture on the limb

Unless specified, the aforementioned afflictions are gained based on chance. This means more damage taken will result in a higher chance of gaining them. The afflictions are gained on the limb in which damage was taken, so afflictions not applicable to the limb will not be gained.

### Treatments:

- Time, unless it is over 100 strength
- [Bandaged](Bandaged.md), unless it is over 100 strength
- [Gel Ice Pack](../Items/Gel%20Ice%20Pack.md), unless it is over 100 strength
- Using [Tweezers](../Items/Tweezers.md) before [Sutures](../Items/Sutures.md) during [Open & Close Surgery](../Procedures/Open%20&%20Close%20Surgery.md)
- [Combat Stimulant](../Items/Combat%20Stimulant.md)
- [Pomegrenade Extract](https://barotraumagame.com/wiki/Pomegrenade_Extract)

## Internal damage:

An uncommon wound which is typically caused by other afflictions and failed skill checks. Unlike other [damage](https://barotraumagame.com/wiki/Damage_(Affliction_Type)), internal damage does not appear in the Health UI.

### Causes:

- [Dislocations](../Bones/Dislocations.md), when they are not[Bandaged](Bandaged.md)
- [Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md), when they do not have a [Plaster Cast](../Extremities/Plaster%20Cast.md)
- Failing the skill check when using:
  - [Tweezers](../Items/Tweezers.md)
  - [Sutures](../Items/Sutures.md)
  - [Skin Retractors](../Items/Skin%20Retractors.md)
  - [Surgical Drill](../Items/Surgical%20Drill.md)
  - [Surgical Saw](../Items/Surgical%20Saw.md)
  - [Spinal Cord Implants](../Items/Spinal%20Cord%20Implants.md)
  - [Osteosynthesis Implants](../Items/Osteosynthesis%20Implants.md)

### Effects:

- Vitality loss, proportional to damage taken
- [Dislocations](../Bones/Dislocations.md)
- Arm and leg [Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md), after taking at least 5 damage
- Skull [Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md), >15 damage, at least 70% chance
- Neck [Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md), >15 damage
- Rib [Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md), >5 damage
- Organ damage or [Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md), random range between 0 and damage taken
- [Pneumothorax](../Lungs/Pneumothorax.md), >5 damage
- [Concussion](../Head_Brain/Concussion.md), >15 damage, at least 70% chance
- [Traumatic Amputation](../Extremities/Traumatic%20Amputation.md), >10 damage and there is a fracture on the limb

### Treatments:

- Time
- Using [Tweezers](../Items/Tweezers.md) before [Sutures](../Items/Sutures.md) during [Open & Close Surgery](../Procedures/Open%20&%20Close%20Surgery.md)
- [Combat Stimulant](../Items/Combat%20Stimulant.md)
- [Pomegrenade Extract](https://barotraumagame.com/wiki/Pomegrenade_Extract)

Unless specified, the aforementioned afflictions are gained based on chance. This means more damage taken will result in a higher chance of gaining them. The afflictions are gained on the limb in which damage was taken, so afflictions not applicable to the limb will not be gained.
