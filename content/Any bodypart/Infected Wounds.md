Infected wounds are caused by letting wounds fester, and should be cleaned in order to prevent [Sepsis](../Blood/Sepsis.md).

---

## Caused by:

- Open [Wounds](archived/Wounds.md) (lacerations, gunshot wounds, bite wounds, deep tissue injuries) fester.
- [Burns](Burns.md)
- This will be sped up dramatically if there is a dirty bandage on a wound.

## Effects:

- [Sepsis](../Blood/Sepsis.md) (at 50% or more)
- [Inflammation](../Symptoms/Inflammation.md) (at 10% or more)
- Decreased immunity

## Treatments:

- [Antibiotic Ointment](../Items/Antibiotic%20Ointment.md)
- [Antiseptic Sprayer](../Items/Antiseptic%20Sprayer.md)
- [Antibiotic Glue](../Items/Antibiotic%20Glue.md)

## First Aid:

- [Bandages](../Items/Bandages.md) or [Plastiseal](../Items/Plastiseal.md)
