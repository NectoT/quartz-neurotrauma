The [https://barotraumagame.com/wiki/Damage_(Affliction_Type)](https://barotraumagame.com/wiki/Damage_(Affliction_Type) "smartCard-inline") that a person may receive is divided into two groups based on their properties, open wounds and [[Internal Wounds](Internal%20Wounds.md)]([Internal Wounds](Internal%20Wounds.md) "smartCard-inline").

All open wounds will cause [[Infected Wounds](Infected%20Wounds.md)]([Infected Wounds](Infected%20Wounds.md) "smartCard-inline") proportional to their severity, and may be treated with [[Sutures](../Items/Sutures.md)]([Sutures](../Items/Sutures.md) "smartCard-inline"). They will also typically, but not always, be caused by sources which also inflict [[Bleeding](Bleeding.md)]([Bleeding](Bleeding.md) "smartCard-inline").

## Lacerations:

A wound typically resulting from injuries involving sharps.

### Causes:

- Sharp weapons such as a [https://barotraumagame.com/wiki/Diving_Knife](https://barotraumagame.com/wiki/Diving_Knife "smartCard-inline")
- Submarine spalling
- Using [[Tweezers](../Items/Tweezers.md)]([Tweezers](../Items/Tweezers.md) "smartCard-inline") when removing [[Foreign Bodies](Foreign%20Bodies.md)]([Foreign Bodies](Foreign%20Bodies.md) "smartCard-inline") or [[Internal Wounds](Internal%20Wounds.md)]([Internal Wounds](Internal%20Wounds.md) "smartCard-inline")

### Effects:

- Vitality loss, proportional to damage taken
- [[Infected Wounds](Infected%20Wounds.md)]([Infected Wounds](Infected%20Wounds.md) "smartCard-inline") over time, depending on severity
- Arm and leg [[Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md)]([Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md) "smartCard-inline"), after taking at least 5 damage
- Skull[[Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md)]([Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md) "smartCard-inline"), >15 damage, at least 70% chance

- [[Traumatic Amputation](../Extremities/Traumatic%20Amputation.md)]([Traumatic Amputation](../Extremities/Traumatic%20Amputation.md) "smartCard-inline"), >1 damage and there is a fracture on the limb

Unless specified, the aforementioned afflictions are gained based on chance. This means more damage taken will result in a higher chance of gaining them. The afflictions are gained on the limb in which damage was taken, so afflictions not applicable to the limb will not be gained.

### Treatments:

- Time, unless it is over 50 strength
- [[Bandaged](Bandaged.md)]([Bandaged](Bandaged.md) "smartCard-inline"), unless it is over 50 strength
