The https://barotraumagame.com/wiki/Damage_(Affliction_Type) that a person may receive is divided into two groups based on their properties, open wounds and [Internal Wounds](Internal%20Wounds.md).

All open wounds will cause [Infected Wounds](Infected%20Wounds.md) proportional to their severity, and may be treated with [Sutures](../Items/Sutures.md). They will also typically, but not always, be caused by sources which also inflict [Bleeding](Bleeding.md).

## Lacerations:

A wound typically resulting from injuries involving sharps.

### Causes:

- Sharp weapons such as a [diving knife](https://barotraumagame.com/wiki/Diving_Knife)
- Submarine spalling
- Using [Tweezers](../Items/Tweezers.md) when removing [Foreign Bodies](Foreign%20Bodies.md) or [Internal Wounds](Internal%20Wounds.md)

### Effects:

- Vitality loss, proportional to damage taken
- [Infected Wounds](Infected%20Wounds.md) over time, depending on severity
- Arm and leg [Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md), after taking at least 5 damage
- Skull[Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md), >15 damage, at least 70% chance
- Rib [Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md), >10 damage
- [Pneumothorax](../Lungs/Pneumothorax.md), >5 damage
- [Cardiac Tamponade](../Heart/Cardiac%20Tamponade.md), >5 damage
- [Internal Bleeding](../Torso/Internal%20Bleeding.md), >5 damage, random range between 0.2-0.5 times damage taken
- [Traumatic Amputation](../Extremities/Traumatic%20Amputation.md), >1 damage and there is a fracture on the limb

Unless specified, the aforementioned afflictions are gained based on chance. This means more damage taken will result in a higher chance of gaining them. The afflictions are gained on the limb in which damage was taken, so afflictions not applicable to the limb will not be gained.

### Treatments:

- Time, unless it is over 50 strength
- [Bandaged](Bandaged.md), unless it is over 50 strength
- [Sutures](../Items/Sutures.md)
- [Pomegrenade Extract](https://barotraumagame.com/wiki/Pomegrenade_Extract)
- [Combat Stimulant](../Items/Combat%20Stimulant.md)

## Deep tissue injury:

A wound typically resulting from injuries involving explosions.

### Causes:

- Explosives such as a [frag grenade](https://barotraumagame.com/wiki/Frag_Grenade)

### Effects:

- Vitality loss, proportional to damage taken
- [Infected Wounds](Infected%20Wounds.md) over time, depending on severity
- Arm and leg [Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md), after taking at least 1 damage
- Skull [Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md), >15 damage, at least 70% chance
- Neck [Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md), >15 damage
- Rib [Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md), >10 damage
- [Pneumothorax](../Lungs/Pneumothorax.md), >5 damage
- [Cardiac Tamponade](../Heart/Cardiac%20Tamponade.md), >5 damage
- [Internal Bleeding](../Torso/Internal%20Bleeding.md), >5 damage, random range between 0.2-0.5 times damage taken
- [Traumatic Amputation](../Extremities/Traumatic%20Amputation.md), >1 damage and there is a fracture on the limb
- [Foreign Bodies](Foreign%20Bodies.md), 75% chance, half of damage taken
- [Concussion](../Head_Brain/Concussion.md), >15 damage, at least 70% chance
- [Dislocations](../Bones/Dislocations.md), >1 damage, 35% chance

Unless specified, the aforementioned afflictions are gained based on chance. This means more damage taken will result in a higher chance of gaining them. The afflictions are gained on the limb in which damage was taken, so afflictions not applicable to the limb will not be gained.

### Treatments:

- Time, unless it is over 50 strength
- [Bandaged](Bandaged.md), unless it is over 50 strength
- [Sutures](../Items/Sutures.md)
- [Pomegrenade Extract](https://barotraumagame.com/wiki/Pomegrenade_Extract)
- [Combat Stimulant](../Items/Combat%20Stimulant.md)

## Gunshot wound:

A wound typically resulting from injuries involving firearms.

- Skull [Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md), >15 damage, at least 70% chance
- Rib [Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md), >1 damage, no more than 30% chance
- [Lung Damage](../Lungs/Lung%20Damage.md), >1 damage, proportional to damage taken
- [Heart Damage](../Heart/Heart%20Damage.md), >5 damage, proportional to damage taken
- [Kidney Damage](../Torso/Kidney%20Damage.md) or [Liver Damage](../Torso/Liver%20Damage.md), >2 damage, proportional to damage taken
- [Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md), >1 damage, a fourth of damage taken
- [Pneumothorax](../Lungs/Pneumothorax.md), >1 damage
- [Cardiac Tamponade](../Heart/Cardiac%20Tamponade.md), >5 damage
- [Internal Bleeding](../Torso/Internal%20Bleeding.md), >5 damage, random range between 0.2-0.6 times damage taken
- [Traumatic Amputation](../Extremities/Traumatic%20Amputation.md), >1 damage and there is a fracture on the limb
- [Foreign Bodies](Foreign%20Bodies.md), up to 30 strength proportional to damage taken when a fracture occurs, or at a 75% chance up to 20 strength proportional to a fourth of damage taken
- [Neurotrauma](../Head_Brain/Neurotrauma.md), >5 damage, 70% chance at a random range between 0.1-0.4 times damage taken

Unless specified, the aforementioned afflictions are gained based on chance. This means more damage taken will result in a higher chance of gaining them. The afflictions are gained on the limb in which damage was taken, so afflictions not applicable to the limb will not be gained. Only one organ can be damaged per instance of gunshot wound.

### Treatments:

- Time, unless it is over 50 strength
