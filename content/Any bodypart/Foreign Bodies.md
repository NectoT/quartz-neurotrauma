Foreign bodies are often acquired after firefights or being caught in an explosion. Foreign bodies should be removed as quickly as possible in order to avoid [Arterial Bleeding](../Extremities/Arterial%20Bleeding.md). Each use of tweezers will remove 5% foreign bodies. The chance of foreign bodies causing issues scales with time and the strength, as shown in the graph at the bottom of this card.
