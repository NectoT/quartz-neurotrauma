# Foreign Bodies

Foreign bodies are often acquired after firefights or being caught in an explosion. Foreign bodies should be removed as quickly as possible in order to avoid [[Arterial Bleeding](../Extremities/Arterial%20Bleeding.md)]([Arterial Bleeding](../Extremities/Arterial%20Bleeding.md) "smartCard-inline") or the patient contracting [[Sepsis](../Blood/Sepsis.md)]([Sepsis](../Blood/Sepsis.md) "smartCard-inline"). Each use of tweezers will remove 5% foreign bodies. The chance of foreign bodies causing issues scales with time and the strength, as shown in the graph at the bottom of this card.
