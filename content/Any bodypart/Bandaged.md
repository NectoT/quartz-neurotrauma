Bandages are an extremely versatile first aid item. It is advised that every crewmember keeps atleast some bandages on them at all times. Bandages will be turned dirty if they are applied on [Wounds](archived/Wounds.md), with bleeding making a bandage dirty much faster than other wounds. Bandaged can be removed with [Trauma Shears](../Items/Trauma%20Shears.md) or [Diving Knife](../Items/Diving%20Knife.md).

## Caused by:

- [Bandages](../Items/Bandages.md) and [Plastiseal](../Items/Plastiseal.md)

- Prevents [Dislocations](../Bones/Dislocations.md) and [Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md) from causing [Internal Damage](archived/Internal%20Damage.md) or  [Intense Pain](../Symptoms/Intense%20Pain.md). Also prevents [Pneumothorax](../Lungs/Pneumothorax.md) from rib fractures. Except for rib and neck fractures, dirty bandages also have this effect
