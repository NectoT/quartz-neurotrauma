Bandages are an extremely versatile first aid item. It is advised that every crewmember keeps atleast some bandages on them at all times. Bandages will be turned dirty if they are applied on [[Wounds](archived/Wounds.md)]([Wounds](archived/Wounds.md) "smartCard-inline"), with bleeding making a bandage dirty much faster than other wounds. Bandaged can be removed with [[Trauma Shears](../Items/Trauma%20Shears.md)]([Trauma Shears](../Items/Trauma%20Shears.md) "smartCard-inline") or [[Diving Knife](../Items/Diving%20Knife.md)]([Diving Knife](../Items/Diving%20Knife.md) "smartCard-inline").
