First degree burns are minor and can usually be ignored, but second degree burns and higher require medical intervention, lest the patient risk contracting an infection. Burns between 1-20% strength are first degree, 21-50% are second degree, and 51% and onwards are third degree. The sum of acid burns and regular burns will be accounted in its degree. It is important to note that, unlike other traumatic afflictions which directly affect vitality, burns will never appear on the [[Health Scanner](../Items/Health%20Scanner.md)]([Health Scanner](../Items/Health%20Scanner.md) "smartCard-inline").
