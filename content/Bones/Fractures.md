Fractures are common injuries, which most crewmembers will get often. Fractures will not kill, and should be treated last in an emergency. Having a fractured limb is required for it to become a [Traumatic Amputation](../Extremities/Traumatic%20Amputation.md), except for that on the head. Cyberlimbs cannot be fractured.
