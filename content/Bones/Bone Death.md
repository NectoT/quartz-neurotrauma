Bone death, while usually not lethal, can kill if you lack [Osteosynthesis Implants](../Items/Osteosynthesis%20Implants.md) . Due to the large amount of implants this affliction takes to cure, it can be rather expensive. This does NOT appear on health hud or scanner as bone death, instead it is labeled as 100% bone damage on the scanner.
