### Medical skill check: 40

A vital organ. The patient’s lung-related afflictions, such as [[Lung Damage](../Lungs/Lung%20Damage.md)]([Lung Damage](../Lungs/Lung%20Damage.md) "smartCard-inline"), are directly linked to it.

The lungs may be removed or transplanted during an [[Organ Transplant Surgery](../Procedures/Organ%20Transplant%20Surgery.md)]([Organ Transplant Surgery](../Procedures/Organ%20Transplant%20Surgery.md) "smartCard-inline") done on the torso. Removal of the lungs causes immediate [[Respiratory Arrest](../Lungs/Respiratory%20Arrest.md)]([Respiratory Arrest](../Lungs/Respiratory%20Arrest.md) "smartCard-inline"), 100% [[Lung Damage](../Lungs/Lung%20Damage.md)]([Lung Damage](../Lungs/Lung%20Damage.md) "smartCard-inline"), and up to 20% [[Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md)]([Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md) "smartCard-inline"), inversely proportional to lung damage before removal. The condition of the organ is inversely proportional to lung damage before removal. The patient cannot gain and will be immediately relieved of [[Pneumothorax](../Lungs/Pneumothorax.md)]([Pneumothorax](../Lungs/Pneumothorax.md) "smartCard-inline"), and will gain [[Oxygen Low](../Lungs/Oxygen%20Low.md)]([Oxygen Low](../Lungs/Oxygen%20Low.md) "smartCard-inline") even if they are receiving [artificial ventilation]([Surgery Table](Surgery%20Table.md) "‌") or wearing an [[AutoPulse](AutoPulse.md)]([AutoPulse](AutoPulse.md) "smartCard-inline"), while their lungs are removed.

If the lungs are transplanted back into the patient, their [[Lung Damage](../Lungs/Lung%20Damage.md)]([Lung Damage](../Lungs/Lung%20Damage.md) "smartCard-inline") and up to 20% [[Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md)]([Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md) "smartCard-inline"), both inversely proportional to the condition of the organ, will be treated, but their [[Respiratory Arrest](../Lungs/Respiratory%20Arrest.md)]([Respiratory Arrest](../Lungs/Respiratory%20Arrest.md) "smartCard-inline") will not be treated. The patient may gain [[Organ Rejection](../Blood/Organ%20Rejection.md)]([Organ Rejection](../Blood/Organ%20Rejection.md) "smartCard-inline") if they receive the organ and their [[Immunity](../Blood/Immunity.md)]([Immunity](../Blood/Immunity.md) "smartCard-inline") is higher than 10%, if the mechanic is toggled on in the mod config.

The condition of the lungs will decay unless placed in a [[Refrigerated Container](Refrigerated%20Container.md)]([Refrigerated Container](Refrigerated%20Container.md) "smartCard-inline") or [[Refrigerated Crate](Refrigerated%20Crate.md)]([Refrigerated Crate](Refrigerated%20Crate.md) "smartCard-inline"). While refrigerated, the organ will slowly regain condition if it is above 90%, otherwise it will not change. If the organ or the container it is in hits the ground from a large height, it will be destroyed.
