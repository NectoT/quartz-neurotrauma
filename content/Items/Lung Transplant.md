### Medical skill check: 40

A vital organ. The patient’s lung-related afflictions, such as [Lung Damage](../Lungs/Lung%20Damage.md), are directly linked to it.

The lungs may be removed or transplanted during an [Organ Transplant Surgery](../Procedures/Organ%20Transplant%20Surgery.md) done on the torso. Removal of the lungs causes immediate [Respiratory Arrest](../Lungs/Respiratory%20Arrest.md), 100% [Lung Damage](../Lungs/Lung%20Damage.md), and up to 20% [Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md), inversely proportional to lung damage before removal. The condition of the organ is inversely proportional to lung damage before removal. The patient cannot gain and will be immediately relieved of [Pneumothorax](../Lungs/Pneumothorax.md), and will gain [Oxygen Low](../Lungs/Oxygen%20Low.md) even if they are receiving [artificial ventilation]([Surgery Table](Surgery%20Table.md) "‌") or wearing an [AutoPulse](AutoPulse.md), while their lungs are removed.

If the lungs are transplanted back into the patient, their [Lung Damage](../Lungs/Lung%20Damage.md) and up to 20% [Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md), both inversely proportional to the condition of the organ, will be treated, but their [Respiratory Arrest](../Lungs/Respiratory%20Arrest.md) will not be treated. The patient may gain [Organ Rejection](../Blood/Organ%20Rejection.md) if they receive the organ and their [Immunity](../Blood/Immunity.md) is higher than 10%, if the mechanic is toggled on in the mod config.

The condition of the lungs will decay unless placed in a [Refrigerated Container](Refrigerated%20Container.md) or [Refrigerated Crate](Refrigerated%20Crate.md). While refrigerated, the organ will slowly regain condition if it is above 90%, otherwise it will not change. If the organ or the container it is in hits the ground from a large height, it will be destroyed.
