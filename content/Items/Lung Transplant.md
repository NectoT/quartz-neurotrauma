### Medical skill check: 40

A vital organ. The patientâ€™s lung-related afflictions, such as [Lung Damage](../Lungs/Lung%20Damage.md), are directly linked to it.

The lungs may be removed or transplanted during an [Organ Transplant Surgery](../Procedures/Organ%20Transplant%20Surgery.md), while their lungs are removed.

If the lungs are transplanted back into the patient, their [Lung Damage](../Lungs/Lung%20Damage.md) is higher than 10%, if the mechanic is toggled on in the mod config.

The condition of the lungs will decay unless placed in a [Refrigerated Container](Refrigerated%20Container.md). While refrigerated, the organ will slowly regain condition if it is above 90%, otherwise it will not change. If the organ or the container it is in hits the ground from a large height, it will be destroyed.
