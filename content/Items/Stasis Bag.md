A special bag that keeps the body in stasis for transportation to proper treatment if injuries are severe. A stasis bag is worn in the diving suit slot, and wearing it will drain the condition of it by 0.25% per second, meaning a stasis bag will last for 400 seconds or roughly 6 and a half minutes. Wearing a stasis bag will protect the wearer from pressure down to 7,000 meters, will allow the wearer to be dragged at full speed, and will stop the negative effects of the following afflictions:

- [Cardiac Arrest](../Heart/Cardiac%20Arrest.md)
- [Respiratory Arrest](../Lungs/Respiratory%20Arrest.md)
- [Heart Attack](../Heart/Heart%20Attack.md)
- [Neurotrauma](../Head_Brain/Neurotrauma.md)
- [Kidney Damage](../Torso/Kidney%20Damage.md)
- [Liver Damage](../Torso/Liver%20Damage.md)
- [Heart Damage](../Heart/Heart%20Damage.md)
- [Lung Damage](../Lungs/Lung%20Damage.md)
- [Bone Damage](../Bones/Bone%20Damage.md)
- [Sepsis](../Blood/Sepsis.md)
- [Hypoxemia](../Blood/Hypoxemia.md)
- [Hypotension](../Blood/Hypotension.md)
- [Hypertension](../Blood/Hypertension.md)
- [Acidosis](../Blood/Acidosis.md)
- [Alkalosis](../Blood/Alkalosis.md)
- [Internal Bleeding](../Torso/Internal%20Bleeding.md)
- [Stroke](../Head_Brain/Stroke.md)
- [Seizure](../Head_Brain/Seizure.md)
- [Coma](../Head_Brain/Coma.md)
- [Infected Wounds](../Any%20bodypart/Infected%20Wounds.md)
- [Bleeding](../Any%20bodypart/Bleeding.md)

Patients in a Stasis Bag cannot receive surgery, and will not be able to receive surgery for 3 seconds after being removed from the bag. They can still receive items such as drugs, however.

Patients removed from the Stasis Bag will have [Cardiac Arrest](../Heart/Cardiac%20Arrest.md) and will need those afflictions treated.
