A vital organ. The patientâ€™s heart-related afflictions, such as [[Heart Damage](../Heart/Heart%20Damage.md)]([Heart Damage](../Heart/Heart%20Damage.md) "smartCard-inline"), are directly linked to it.

The heart may be removed or transplanted during an [[Organ Transplant Surgery](../Procedures/Organ%20Transplant%20Surgery.md)]([Organ Transplant Surgery](../Procedures/Organ%20Transplant%20Surgery.md) "smartCard-inline") done on the torso. Removal of the heart causes immediate [[Cardiac Arrest](../Heart/Cardiac%20Arrest.md)]([Cardiac Arrest](../Heart/Cardiac%20Arrest.md) "smartCard-inline"), 100% [[Heart Damage](../Heart/Heart%20Damage.md)]([Heart Damage](../Heart/Heart%20Damage.md) "smartCard-inline"), and up to 20% [[Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md)]([Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md) "smartCard-inline"), inversely proportional to heart damage before removal. The condition of the organ is inversely proportional to heart damage before removal. The patient cannot gain and will be immediately relieved of [[Cardiac Tamponade](../Heart/Cardiac%20Tamponade.md)]([Cardiac Tamponade](../Heart/Cardiac%20Tamponade.md) "smartCard-inline") and [[Heart Attack](../Heart/Heart%20Attack.md)]([Heart Attack](../Heart/Heart%20Attack.md) "smartCard-inline") while their heart is removed.

If a heart is transplanted back into the patient, their [[Heart Damage](../Heart/Heart%20Damage.md)]([Heart Damage](../Heart/Heart%20Damage.md) "smartCard-inline") and up to 20% [[Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md)]([Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md) "smartCard-inline"), both inversely proportional to the condition of the organ, will be treated, but their [[Cardiac Arrest](../Heart/Cardiac%20Arrest.md)]([Cardiac Arrest](../Heart/Cardiac%20Arrest.md) "smartCard-inline") will not be treated. The patient may gain [[Organ Rejection](../Blood/Organ%20Rejection.md)]([Organ Rejection](../Blood/Organ%20Rejection.md) "smartCard-inline") if they receive the organ and their [[Immunity](../Blood/Immunity.md)]([Immunity](../Blood/Immunity.md) "smartCard-inline") is higher than 10%, if the mechanic is toggled on in the mod config.

The condition of a heart will decay unless placed in a [[Refrigerated Container](Refrigerated%20Container.md)]([Refrigerated Container](Refrigerated%20Container.md) "smartCard-inline") or [[Refrigerated Crate](Refrigerated%20Crate.md)]([Refrigerated Crate](Refrigerated%20Crate.md) "smartCard-inline"). While refrigerated, the organ will slowly regain condition if it is above 90%, otherwise it will not change. If the organ or the container it is in hits the ground from a large height, it will be destroyed.
