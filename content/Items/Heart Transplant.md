### Medical skill check: 40

A vital organ. The patientâ€™s heart-related afflictions, such as [Heart Damage](../Heart/Heart%20Damage.md), are directly linked to it.

The heart may be removed or transplanted during an [Organ Transplant Surgery](../Procedures/Organ%20Transplant%20Surgery.md) while their heart is removed.

If a heart is transplanted back into the patient, their [Heart Damage](../Heart/Heart%20Damage.md) is higher than 10%, if the mechanic is toggled on in the mod config.

The condition of a heart will decay unless placed in a [Refrigerated Container](Refrigerated%20Container.md). While refrigerated, the organ will slowly regain condition if it is above 90%, otherwise it will not change. If the organ or the container it is in hits the ground from a large height, it will be destroyed.
