### Medical skill check: 40

A vital organ. The patientâ€™s [Liver Damage](../Torso/Liver%20Damage.md) is directly linked to it.

The liver may be removed or transplanted during an [Organ Transplant Surgery](../Procedures/Organ%20Transplant%20Surgery.md) done on the torso. Removal of the liver causes 100% [Liver Damage](../Torso/Liver%20Damage.md) and up to 20% [Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md), inversely proportional to liver damage before removal. The condition of the organ is inversely proportional to liver damage before removal.

If a heart is transplanted back into the patient, their [Liver Damage](../Torso/Liver%20Damage.md) and up to 20% [Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md), both inversely proportional to the condition of the organ, will be treated. The patient may gain [Organ Rejection](../Blood/Organ%20Rejection.md) if they receive the organ and their [Immunity](../Blood/Immunity.md) is higher than 10%, if the mechanic is toggled on in the mod config.

The condition of a liver will decay unless placed in a [Refrigerated Container](Refrigerated%20Container.md) or [Refrigerated Crate](Refrigerated%20Crate.md). While refrigerated, the organ will slowly regain condition if it is above 90%, otherwise it will not change. If the organ or the container it is in hits the ground from a large height, it will be destroyed.
