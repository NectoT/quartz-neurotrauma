### Medical skill check: 40

A vital organ. The patientâ€™s [[Liver Damage](../Torso/Liver%20Damage.md)]([Liver Damage](../Torso/Liver%20Damage.md) "smartCard-inline") is directly linked to it.

The liver may be removed or transplanted during an [[Organ Transplant Surgery](../Procedures/Organ%20Transplant%20Surgery.md)]([Organ Transplant Surgery](../Procedures/Organ%20Transplant%20Surgery.md) "smartCard-inline") done on the torso. Removal of the liver causes 100% [[Liver Damage](../Torso/Liver%20Damage.md)]([Liver Damage](../Torso/Liver%20Damage.md) "smartCard-inline") and up to 20% [[Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md)]([Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md) "smartCard-inline"), inversely proportional to liver damage before removal. The condition of the organ is inversely proportional to liver damage before removal.

If a heart is transplanted back into the patient, their [[Liver Damage](../Torso/Liver%20Damage.md)]([Liver Damage](../Torso/Liver%20Damage.md) "smartCard-inline") and up to 20% [[Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md)]([Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md) "smartCard-inline"), both inversely proportional to the condition of the organ, will be treated. The patient may gain [[Organ Rejection](../Blood/Organ%20Rejection.md)]([Organ Rejection](../Blood/Organ%20Rejection.md) "smartCard-inline") if they receive the organ and their [[Immunity](../Blood/Immunity.md)]([Immunity](../Blood/Immunity.md) "smartCard-inline") is higher than 10%, if the mechanic is toggled on in the mod config.

The condition of a liver will decay unless placed in a [[Refrigerated Container](Refrigerated%20Container.md)]([Refrigerated Container](Refrigerated%20Container.md) "smartCard-inline") or [[Refrigerated Crate](Refrigerated%20Crate.md)]([Refrigerated Crate](Refrigerated%20Crate.md) "smartCard-inline"). While refrigerated, the organ will slowly regain condition if it is above 90%, otherwise it will not change. If the organ or the container it is in hits the ground from a large height, it will be destroyed.
