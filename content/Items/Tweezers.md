### Medical skill check: 30

A pair of tweezers used to remove damaged tissue or bullets.
Its effects depend on if:

there is [Retracted Skin](../Surgery/Retracted%20Skin.md), gunshot wound or deep tissue injury on the limb (surgery use case)

or none of those apply (no surgery use case)

### Application effects (no surgery):

- minor [Bleeding](../Any%20bodypart/Bleeding.md)
- minor [[Open Wounds#Lacerations|Lacerations]]
- [Intense Pain](../Symptoms/Intense%20Pain.md)

### Application success (surgery):

- -3% to -10% [[Internal Wounds#Internal damage|Internal Damage]]
- -3% to -10% [[Internal Wounds#Blunt force trauma|Blunt force trauma]]
- -3% to -10% [Foreign Bodies](../Any%20bodypart/Foreign%20Bodies.md)
- +5% [[Open Wounds#Lacerations|Lacerations]]

### Application failure (surgery):

- +6% [[Internal Wounds#Internal damage|Internal Damage]]

The tweezers can work without [Retracted Skin](../Surgery/Retracted%20Skin.md)  if the limb you are tweezing has gunshot wounds or deep tissue injuries, using the tweezer through gunshot wounds or deep tissue injuries will cause 5% [Traumatic Shock](../Surgery/Traumatic%20Shock.md) . Do note that tweezing through gunshot wounds or deep tissue injuries only works on foreign bodies, and not on blunt force trauma. Tweezing out foreign bodies also has a 5% chance to yield scrap.

Using tweezers in cases where it otherwise wouldnâ€™t do anything will cause you to pinch the patient instead, causing minor damage which is worse if on the head.
