### Medical skill check: 30

A pair of tweezers used to remove damaged tissue or bullets.
Its effects depend on if:

there is [[Retracted Skin](../Surgery/Retracted%20Skin.md)]([Retracted Skin](../Surgery/Retracted%20Skin.md) "smartCard-inline"), gunshot wound or deep tissue injury on the limb (surgery use case)

or none of those apply (no surgery use case)

### Application effects (no surgery):

- minor [[Bleeding](../Any%20bodypart/Bleeding.md)]([Bleeding](../Any%20bodypart/Bleeding.md) "smartCard-inline")
- minor [lacerations]([Wounds](../Any%20bodypart/archived/Wounds.md) "‌")
- [[Intense Pain](../Symptoms/Intense%20Pain.md)]([Intense Pain](../Symptoms/Intense%20Pain.md) "smartCard-inline")

### Application success (surgery):

- -3% to -10% [[Internal Damage](../Any%20bodypart/archived/Internal%20Damage.md)]([Internal Damage](../Any%20bodypart/archived/Internal%20Damage.md) "smartCard-inline")
- -3% to -10% [Blunt force trauma]([Wounds](../Any%20bodypart/archived/Wounds.md) "‌")
- -3% to -10% [[Foreign Bodies](../Any%20bodypart/Foreign%20Bodies.md)]([Foreign Bodies](../Any%20bodypart/Foreign%20Bodies.md) "smartCard-inline")
- +5% [Lacerations]([Wounds](../Any%20bodypart/archived/Wounds.md) "‌")

### Application failure (surgery):

- +6% [[Internal Damage](../Any%20bodypart/archived/Internal%20Damage.md)]([Internal Damage](../Any%20bodypart/archived/Internal%20Damage.md) "smartCard-inline")

The tweezers can work without [[Retracted Skin](../Surgery/Retracted%20Skin.md)]([Retracted Skin](../Surgery/Retracted%20Skin.md) "smartCard-inline")  if the limb you are tweezing has gunshot wounds or deep tissue injuries, using the tweezer through gunshot wounds or deep tissue injuries will cause 5% [[Traumatic Shock](../Surgery/Traumatic%20Shock.md)]([Traumatic Shock](../Surgery/Traumatic%20Shock.md) "smartCard-inline") . Do note that tweezing through gunshot wounds or deep tissue injuries only works on foreign bodies, and not on blunt force trauma. Tweezing out foreign bodies also has a 5% chance to yield scrap.

Using tweezers in cases where it otherwise wouldn’t do anything will cause you to pinch the patient instead, causing minor damage which is worse if on the head.
