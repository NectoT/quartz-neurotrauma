A medic's best friend. To use the autopulse, simply wear it in your diving suit slot. While worn and equipped with batteries, the autopulse will cure [Cardiac Arrest](../Heart/Cardiac%20Arrest.md) and slightly treat [Oxygen Low](../Lungs/Oxygen%20Low.md) and [Fibrillation](../Heart/Fibrillation.md), as well as increasing your blood pressure. Be wary to not overuse it, however, as it will increase your blood pressure into [unwanted levels]([Hypertension](../Blood/Hypertension.md) "â€Œ"). It can be forcibly removed by using the [Wrench](Wrench.md) as a treatment on the torso of a person wearing it, as long as the person is not [Unconsciousness](../Head_Brain/Unconsciousness.md). Doing so will place it in the inventory of the wrench user.
