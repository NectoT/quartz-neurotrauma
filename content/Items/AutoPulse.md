A medic's best friend. To use the autopulse, simply wear it in your diving suit slot. While worn and equipped with batteries, the autopulse will cure [[Cardiac Arrest](../Heart/Cardiac%20Arrest.md)]([Cardiac Arrest](../Heart/Cardiac%20Arrest.md) "smartCard-inline") and slightly treat [[Oxygen Low](../Lungs/Oxygen%20Low.md)]([Oxygen Low](../Lungs/Oxygen%20Low.md) "smartCard-inline") and [[Fibrillation](../Heart/Fibrillation.md)]([Fibrillation](../Heart/Fibrillation.md) "smartCard-inline"), as well as increasing your blood pressure. Be wary to not overuse it, however, as it will increase your blood pressure into [unwanted levels]([Hypertension](../Blood/Hypertension.md) "â€Œ"). It can be forcibly removed by using the [[Wrench](Wrench.md)]([Wrench](Wrench.md) "smartCard-inline") as a treatment on the torso of a person wearing it, as long as the person is not [[Unconsciousness](../Head_Brain/Unconsciousness.md)]([Unconsciousness](../Head_Brain/Unconsciousness.md) "smartCard-inline"). Doing so will place it in the inventory of the wrench user.
