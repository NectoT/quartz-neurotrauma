The Body Bag is an item used to transport bodies much more quickly than simply dragging them. It is placed into the Diving Suit slot and will suffocate a living human if they are placed into it. It can be forcibly removed by using the [[Wrench](Wrench.md)]([Wrench](Wrench.md) "smartCard-inline") as a treatment on the torso of a person wearing it, as long as the person is not [[Unconsciousness](../Head_Brain/Unconsciousness.md)]([Unconsciousness](../Head_Brain/Unconsciousness.md) "smartCard-inline"). Doing so will place it in the inventory of the wrench user.
