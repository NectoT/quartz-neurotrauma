---

An item used to correct the heartbeat of a patient. When used on a patient and charged with batteries, the aed has a chance to either reset [[Fibrillation](../Heart/Fibrillation.md)]([Fibrillation](../Heart/Fibrillation.md) "smartCard-inline"), or cure [[Cardiac Arrest](../Heart/Cardiac%20Arrest.md)]([Cardiac Arrest](../Heart/Cardiac%20Arrest.md) "smartCard-inline").

The chance for these is depicted in this graph, with cyan being the chance to reset fibrillation, pink being the chance to cause cardiac arrest and orange being the chance to cure it. The X axis is medical skill and the Y axis is the chance to do something (with 1 being 100%).

At medical skill below 80, the [[Manual Defibrillator](Manual%20Defibrillator.md)]([Manual Defibrillator](Manual%20Defibrillator.md) "smartCard-inline") is worse in all regards. At 100 medical skill, the manual defibrillator is better in all regards.
