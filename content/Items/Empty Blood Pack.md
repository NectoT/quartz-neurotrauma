### Medical skill check: 30

Empty blood packs are used for acquiring [Blood Packs](Blood%20Packs.md). Empty blood packs can only be used on humans with less than 31% [Blood Loss](../Blood/Blood%20Loss.md), otherwise it does nothing.

### Application success:

\+30% [Blood Loss](../Blood/Blood%20Loss.md)

### Application failure:

\+40% [Blood Loss](../Blood/Blood%20Loss.md)

If the human that the empty blood pack is used on is suffering from either [Acidosis](../Blood/Acidosis.md), [Alkalosis](../Blood/Alkalosis.md) or [Sepsis](../Blood/Sepsis.md), then those afflictions will also be given to whoever the blood is given to (affliction gained will be the donor's affliction level at time of extraction divided by 5).
