# Multipurpose Scalpel

---

The Multipurpose Scalpel combines the functionality of the regular scalpel, the organ procurement scalpels, and the trauma shears, while also providing the user with a way of intentionally harming the patient.

### How to change mode:

Equip the scalpel in their hand and select the appropriate mode via UI buttons.

It is craftable at a regular fabricator.

While in bandages/casts/malpractice mode, as long as the patient has a bandage or a cast, the item functions identically to trauma shears.
Is this not the case, then using it will result in the patient getting stabbed. Depending on location and surgical status of the patient, this can cause serious damage.

Notable outcomes include:

- a chance for causing fractures in extremeties that are currently opened for surgery
- causing neurotrauma on opened heads
- causing specific organ damage and internal bleeding on opened torsos
