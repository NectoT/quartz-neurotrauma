A container which shares many properties with the [https://barotraumagame.com/wiki/Storage_Container](https://barotraumagame.com/wiki/Storage_Container "smartCard-inline"). It has 6 slots and may hold any small item. However, its main use is to hold organ transplants (except for the [[Brain Transplant](Brain%20Transplant.md)]([Brain Transplant](Brain%20Transplant.md) "smartCard-inline")), severed limbs, and [[Gel Ice Pack](Gel%20Ice%20Pack.md)]([Gel Ice Pack](Gel%20Ice%20Pack.md) "smartCard-inline")s. This will prevent the items from naturally losing condition. Organ transplants will slowly regain condition if they are above 90%, limbs above 95%, and gel ice packs at any condition.

Organ transplants may be destroyed if they are placed in the container and it is dropped from a large height.

The container will refrigerate:
