A container which shares many properties with the [storage containers](https://barotraumagame.com/wiki/Storage_Containers). It has 6 slots and may hold any small item. However, its main use is to hold organ transplants (except for the [Brain Transplant](Brain%20Transplant.md), severed limbs, and [Gel Ice Pack](Gel%20Ice%20Pack.md)s. This will prevent the items from naturally losing condition. Organ transplants will slowly regain condition if they are above 90%, limbs above 95%, and gel ice packs at any condition.

Organ transplants may be destroyed if they are placed in the container and it is dropped from a large height.

The container will refrigerate:

- [Heart Transplant](Heart%20Transplant.md)
- [Kidney Transplant](Kidney%20Transplant.md)
- [Liver Transplant](Liver%20Transplant.md)
- [Lung Transplant](Lung%20Transplant.md)
- [Arm (Bionic / Severed)](Arm%20(Bionic%20_%20Severed).md)
- [Leg (Bionic / Severed)](Leg%20(Bionic%20_%20Severed).md)
- [Gel Ice Pack](Gel%20Ice%20Pack.md)
