### Medical skill check: 100

A vital organ. The patientâ€™s consciousness and [Neurotrauma](../Head_Brain/Neurotrauma.md) are directly linked to it. Unlike other organs, the brain is typically not transplanted.

The brain may be removed or transplanted during an [Organ Transplant Surgery](../Procedures/Organ%20Transplant%20Surgery.md), and continuous rapid neurotrauma gain, all of which will persist as long as the organ is removed. The condition of the organ is inversely proportional to neurotrauma, up to 100%. Removing a brain at 100% or more neurotrauma will not produce a brain transplant and the patient will immediately reach 200% neurotrauma, killing them.

If the brain is transplanted back into the patient, they will regain control of the character, but their [Cardiac Arrest](../Heart/Cardiac%20Arrest.md)  must still be treated. If the brain is transplanted into another patient, the donor will take control of that patient.

Unlike other organs, the condition of the brain will always decay rapidly, even in a refrigerated container, unless it is placed in a [Brain Jar](../Surgery%20Plus%20Expansion/Brain%20Jar.md). If the brain or the container it is in ever touches the ground, it will be destroyed, unless if it is in a brain jar.
