### Medical skill check: 22

An improved version of [Bandaged](../Any%20bodypart/Bandaged.md), which can more effectively treat wounds.

### Application success:

\+100% [Bandaged](../Any%20bodypart/Bandaged.md)
\-48% [Bleeding](../Any%20bodypart/Bleeding.md)
\-24% [Burns](../Any%20bodypart/Burns.md)

### Application failure:

\+50% [Bandaged](../Any%20bodypart/Bandaged.md)
\-24% [Bleeding](../Any%20bodypart/Bleeding.md)
\-12% [Burns](../Any%20bodypart/Burns.md)

Applying plastiseal will also replace any dirty bandages on the limb the bandage is applied to. Plastiseal can also be used after [Retracted Skin](../Surgery/Retracted%20Skin.md) in order to treat third degree burns.
