A container which shares many properties with waterproof [https://barotraumagame.com/wiki/Crates](https://barotraumagame.com/wiki/Crates "smartCard-inline"). It has 12 slots and may hold any small item. However, its main use is to hold organ transplants (except for the [[Brain Transplant](Brain%20Transplant.md)]([Brain Transplant](Brain%20Transplant.md) "smartCard-inline")), severed limbs, and [[Gel Ice Pack](Gel%20Ice%20Pack.md)]([Gel Ice Pack](Gel%20Ice%20Pack.md) "smartCard-inline")s. This will prevent the items from naturally losing condition. Organ transplants will slowly regain condition if they are above 90%, limbs above 95%, and gel ice packs at any condition.

Organ transplants may be destroyed if they are placed in the crate and it is dropped from a large height.

The container will refrigerate:

- [[Heart Transplant](Heart%20Transplant.md)]([Heart Transplant](Heart%20Transplant.md) "smartCard-inline")
- [[Kidney Transplant](Kidney%20Transplant.md)]([Kidney Transplant](Kidney%20Transplant.md) "smartCard-inline")
- [[Liver Transplant](Liver%20Transplant.md)]([Liver Transplant](Liver%20Transplant.md) "smartCard-inline")
- [[Lung Transplant](Lung%20Transplant.md)]([Lung Transplant](Lung%20Transplant.md) "smartCard-inline")
- [[Arm (Bionic / Severed)](Arm%20(Bionic%20_%20Severed).md)]([Arm (Bionic / Severed)](Arm%20(Bionic%20_%20Severed).md) "smartCard-inline")
- [[Leg (Bionic / Severed)](Leg%20(Bionic%20_%20Severed).md)]([Leg (Bionic / Severed)](Leg%20(Bionic%20_%20Severed).md) "smartCard-inline")
- [[Gel Ice Pack](Gel%20Ice%20Pack.md)]([Gel Ice Pack](Gel%20Ice%20Pack.md) "smartCard-inline")
