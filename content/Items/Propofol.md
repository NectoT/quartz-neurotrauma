**Propofol is no longer craftable**

A drug used to induce controlled [Unconsciousness](../Head_Brain/Unconsciousness.md)  for the purpose of preventing [Traumatic Shock](../Surgery/Traumatic%20Shock.md).

Upon use, the patient will gain [Anesthesia](../Torso/Anesthesia.md) at 0.3% per second. Between 1-15% anesthesia, the patient will have 5% [Analgesia](../Torso/Analgesia.md). Beyond 15% anesthesia, the patient will be unconscious. At 100% anesthesia, the patient will no longer be under the effect of propofol. Application of [Anaparalyzant](Anaparalyzant.md) will reduce anesthesia to 0%, also removing its effect.

Side effects of propofol include:

- [Hypotension](../Blood/Hypotension.md)
- [Confusion](../Symptoms/Confusion%201.md)
- [Blurred Vision](../Symptoms/Blurred%20Vision.md)
