### Medical skill check: 40

A fine powder that when used in conjunction with [[Bandaged](../Any%20bodypart/Bandaged.md)]([Bandaged](../Any%20bodypart/Bandaged.md) "smartCard-inline"), will encase a limb in a [[Plaster Cast](../Extremities/Plaster%20Cast.md)]([Plaster Cast](../Extremities/Plaster%20Cast.md) "smartCard-inline"), in order to heal [[Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md)]([Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md) "smartCard-inline"). Gypsum will not work if you have not used [[Bandages](Bandages.md)]([Bandages](Bandages.md) "smartCard-inline")  or [[Plastiseal](Plastiseal.md)]([Plastiseal](Plastiseal.md) "smartCard-inline") beforehand, and **will do nothing for skull, rib and neck fractures.**

For each plaster cast applied to the player, they will get a 20% movement speed debuff. Plaster casts can be removed with [[Trauma Shears](Trauma%20Shears.md)]([Trauma Shears](Trauma%20Shears.md) "smartCard-inline").

### Application success:

Turns the applied [bandage]([Bandaged](../Any%20bodypart/Bandaged.md) "â€Œ") into a [[Plaster Cast](../Extremities/Plaster%20Cast.md)]([Plaster Cast](../Extremities/Plaster%20Cast.md) "smartCard-inline"), which will slowly heal arm and leg fractures encased in it.

### Application failure:

Deletes the gypsum and does nothing.
