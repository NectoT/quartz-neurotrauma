The third step in [Aortic Rupture Surgery](../Procedures/Aortic%20Rupture%20Surgery.md). The balloon will **not** work without 100% [Surgery Incision](../Surgery/Surgery%20Incision.md). Using the balloon will block the aorta, which will prevent [Blood Loss](../Blood/Blood%20Loss.md) caused by [Aortic Rupture](../Torso/Aortic%20Rupture.md), and will treat regular bleeding, but will also cause [Gangrene](../Extremities/Gangrene.md).
