### Medical skill check: 40

A pair of vital organs. The patientâ€™s [Kidney Damage](../Torso/Kidney%20Damage.md).

The kidneys may be removed or transplanted during an [Organ Transplant Surgery](../Procedures/Organ%20Transplant%20Surgery.md), inversely proportional to kidney damage before removal. The condition of the organs are inversely proportional to kidney damage before removal, up to 50% for each kidney. Therefore, removal of the kidneys at 25% kidney damage will produce one kidney at 100% and another one at 50%.

If the kidneys are transplanted back into the patient, up to 50% [Kidney Damage](../Torso/Kidney%20Damage.md) is higher than 10%, if the mechanic is enabled in the mod config.

The condition of a kidney will decay unless placed in a [Refrigerated Container](Refrigerated%20Container.md). While refrigerated, the organ will slowly regain condition if it is above 90%, otherwise it will not change. If the organ or the container it is in is dropped from a large height, it will be destroyed.
