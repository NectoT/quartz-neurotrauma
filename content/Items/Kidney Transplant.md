### Medical skill check: 40

A pair of vital organs. The patientâ€™s [Kidney Damage](../Torso/Kidney%20Damage.md) is directly related to it. Unlike other organs, patients will have two kidneys, which are individually damaged. At 50% kidney damage, only one kidney has failed, while the other kidney will be functional. A patient may be healthy with only one kidney. By itself, 50% kidney damage will not cause lethal [Hypertension](../Blood/Hypertension.md).

The kidneys may be removed or transplanted during an [Organ Transplant Surgery](../Procedures/Organ%20Transplant%20Surgery.md) done on the torso. Removing the kidneys will remove both at once, causing 100%[Kidney Damage](../Torso/Kidney%20Damage.md) and up to 20% [Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md), inversely proportional to kidney damage before removal. The condition of the organs are inversely proportional to kidney damage before removal, up to 50% for each kidney. Therefore, removal of the kidneys at 25% kidney damage will produce one kidney at 100% and another one at 50%.

If the kidneys are transplanted back into the patient, up to 50% [Kidney Damage](../Torso/Kidney%20Damage.md) and up to 10% [Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md) per kidney, both inversely proportional to their condition, will be treated. The patient may gain [Organ Rejection](../Blood/Organ%20Rejection.md) if they receive the organ and their [Immunity](../Blood/Immunity.md) is higher than 10%, if the mechanic is enabled in the mod config.

The condition of a kidney will decay unless placed in a [Refrigerated Container](Refrigerated%20Container.md) or [Refrigerated Crate](Refrigerated%20Crate.md). While refrigerated, the organ will slowly regain condition if it is above 90%, otherwise it will not change. If the organ or the container it is in is dropped from a large height, it will be destroyed.
