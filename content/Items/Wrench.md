### Medical skill check: 60 (30 if the patient has [Analgesia](../Torso/Analgesia.md)

The wrench is used to treat [Dislocations](../Bones/Dislocations.md). To use, drag it onto the dislocated limb in the health interface and use it as a treatment, like you would a bandage. If the limb has no dislocation, the wrench will not do anything.

The wrench can also be used to remove an [AutoPulse](AutoPulse.md) or [Body Bag](Body%20Bag.md) from a person, as long as they arenâ€™t [Unconsciousness](../Head_Brain/Unconsciousness.md), by using the wrench on their torso as treatment. The item will be placed in the inventory of the wrench user.

Other vanilla wrenches are able to perform the same actions, including:

### Application success:

### Application failure:
