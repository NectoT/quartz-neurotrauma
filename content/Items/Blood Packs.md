Blood packs are acquired from using an [Empty Blood Pack](Empty%20Blood%20Pack.md). Blood packs must be administered to the correct bloodtype, which is stated in the description of the item.

### Compatible blood type application

\-30% [Blood Loss](../Blood/Blood%20Loss.md)
\+30% blood pressure

### Incompatible blood type application

\-20% [Blood Loss](../Blood/Blood%20Loss.md)
\+30% blood pressure
\+100% [Hemotransfusion Shock](../Blood/Hemotransfusion%20Shock.md)

If the human that the blood pack came from was suffering from either [Acidosis](../Blood/Acidosis.md) will show if it has any of these afflictions and their strength. Additionally, if a recipient has acidosis or alkalosis, administering neutral blood will partially treat it, unless they have 0% bloodloss.
