### Medical skill check: 20

A consumable needle that reduces the strength of [[Pneumothorax](../Lungs/Pneumothorax.md)]([Pneumothorax](../Lungs/Pneumothorax.md) "smartCard-inline") to 5%, but does not treat it. If the patient does not have pneumothorax, the needle will give them pneumothorax instead.

### Application success:

- Reduces [[Pneumothorax](../Lungs/Pneumothorax.md)]([Pneumothorax](../Lungs/Pneumothorax.md) "smartCard-inline") to 5% over time and prevents it from worsening until the Needle affliction wears off.

### Application failure:

\+10% [[Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md)]([Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md) "smartCard-inline")
\+10% [[Bleeding](../Any%20bodypart/Bleeding.md)]([Bleeding](../Any%20bodypart/Bleeding.md) "smartCard-inline")
