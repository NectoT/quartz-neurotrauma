The Surgery Table is an item that can be bought from a station or crafted and then placed down. The patient is not required to be _on_ the table, they only need to be _near_ it. The Surgery Table provides artificial ventilation to everyone near the table and prevents [Traumatic Shock](../Surgery/Traumatic%20Shock.md).

The table also has wiring pins that can be used to output important information, such as blood pressure, [Acidosis](../Blood/Acidosis.md), heart rate, and breathing rate.

It should be noted that the Surgery Table is functionally identical to a Hospital Bed. The other beds prevent Traumatic Shock **if you're laying on them**, but they do not provide artificial ventilation.
