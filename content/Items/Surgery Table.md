The Surgery Table is an item that can be bought from a station or crafted and then placed down. The patient is not required to be _on_ the table, they only need to be _near_ it. The Surgery Table provides artificial ventilation to everyone near the table and prevents [[Traumatic Shock](../Surgery/Traumatic%20Shock.md)]([Traumatic Shock](../Surgery/Traumatic%20Shock.md) "smartCard-inline") provided the patient is under [[Analgesia](../Torso/Analgesia.md)]([Analgesia](../Torso/Analgesia.md) "smartCard-inline"). Additionally, the table will decrease [[Oxygen Low](../Lungs/Oxygen%20Low.md)]([Oxygen Low](../Lungs/Oxygen%20Low.md) "smartCard-inline") and prevent [[Respiratory Arrest](../Lungs/Respiratory%20Arrest.md)]([Respiratory Arrest](../Lungs/Respiratory%20Arrest.md) "smartCard-inline") and [[Hypoventilation](../Lungs/Hypoventilation.md)]([Hypoventilation](../Lungs/Hypoventilation.md) "smartCard-inline") from increasing [[Acidosis](../Blood/Acidosis.md)]([Acidosis](../Blood/Acidosis.md) "smartCard-inline").

The table also has wiring pins that can be used to output important information, such as blood pressure, [[Acidosis](../Blood/Acidosis.md)]([Acidosis](../Blood/Acidosis.md) "smartCard-inline"), heart rate, and breathing rate.

It should be noted that the Surgery Table is functionally identical to a Hospital Bed. The other beds prevent Traumatic Shock **if you're laying on them**, but they do not provide artificial ventilation.
