## Q: Why can't I find a specific affliction/item?

A: Try scrolling to the right first, or searching with ctrl + F, as there are more categories to the right. If you still don't find it, put a comment down on this card (if you have a Trello account) or join [the Discord server ](https://discord.gg/4Yku7qPCYN "‌")and report the missing affliction/item.

## Q: What is the difference between Symptoms and other afflictions?

A: Symptoms are afflictions that don't do anything on their own, and merely exist to make diagnosis easier, while other afflictions have effects that actually impact gameplay.

## Q: Some of the information here is incorrect. How can I get you to fix it?

A: As with the first question, simply put a comment on this card (if you have a Trello account) or join [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/4Yku7qPCYN "‌") and report the issue.

## Q: Why is the guide on Trello instead of Steam now?

A: The steam guide was heavily riddled with misinformation, and generally Steam has a bad layout for this kind of stuff.
