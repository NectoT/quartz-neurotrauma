#If the patient is in immediate danger of dying put them in a https://trello.com/c/KbUJkuh6/137-stasis-bag
A stasis bag will give you 6 minutes of paused afflictions to diagnose, figure out your treatment plan, and administer any treatments short of surgery.

###Suggested treatments in order of importance
1. Put them in stasis bag if they're in rapidly deteriorating condition
2. Diagnose problems and figure out which steps from below are relevant
3. https://trello.com/c/uMHK6anv/103-tourniquet any https://trello.com/c/hVXaTXlX/71-arterial-bleeding
4. If there's major regular bleeding, https://trello.com/c/EIxAXxJq/72-sutures them, give https://trello.com/c/kmwykfmE/80-blood-packs if necessary and continue doing so in further steps if necessary. If they have internal or aortic bleeding, that will need to be fixed before transfusing blood or you will waste blood bags. Consider using liquid oxygenite further down to stabilize the patient for those surgeries.
5. Use a https://trello.com/c/SwnGlAdq/104-needle if https://trello.com/c/k69w3cw7/6-pneumothorax is high
6. If in https://trello.com/c/KbUJkuh6/137-stasis-bag, prep patient for removal from bag, give any drugs if they need it
\- https://trello.com/c/tJZuBpw6/172-azathioprine: if they need later organ transplants
\- Antirad or stabilozine: radiation sickness **IMPORTANT**
\- https://trello.com/c/iJvfBEmr/143-broad-spectrum-antibiotics: sepsis
\- https://trello.com/c/pPZ3rOFn/101-mannitol: neurotrama reduction or healing if their blood is stable
\- https://trello.com/c/A8Dl8a55/135-morphine: painkiller for surgery
\- https://trello.com/c/jAWg0ANe/129-thiamine: organ damage healing
Then take them out of the stasis bag to start surgery (here's where you apply https://trello.com/c/fque4kVs/142-liquid-oxygenite if you're going to after using a stasis bag)
7. First aid for heartbeat/breathing if they're arrested or about to arrest (or if just taken out of stasis bag, as that arrests heartbeat and breathing). Skip this step if they have massive internal or aortic bleeding to fix first.
8. Fix https://trello.com/c/CKxExfJX/124-aortic-rupture, https://trello.com/c/YTI4tWKL/68-internal-bleeding, and https://trello.com/c/hVXaTXlX/71-arterial-bleeding properly. Give more blood if needed.
9. Properly fix any heart/breathing problems, including using https://trello.com/c/5hBJpmtH/105-drainage to fix https://trello.com/c/k69w3cw7/6-pneumothorax
10. Fix bad https://trello.com/c/xnnF9NDb/90-burns (high second degree or any third degree)
\- Second degree: https://trello.com/c/346yO2RT/112-antibiotic-ointment or https://trello.com/c/Jpb5HdHV/117-bandages if that limb doesn't need surgery 
\- Third degree: https://trello.com/c/0VKcnDDx/141-antibiotic-glue, or if that limb needs surgery, wait till the end of surgery and use https://trello.com/c/v8VxUr2S/118-plastiseal before the closing https://trello.com/c/EIxAXxJq/72-sutures.
11. Do https://trello.com/c/mVYXho0A/82-osteosynthesis-implants surgeries on head/neck/chest https://trello.com/c/HKGh6Ixe/32-fractures and then https://trello.com/c/5Ft0dhpd/114-spinal-cord-implants surgery on https://trello.com/c/8cORwdoC/55-spinal-cord-injury
12. https://trello.com/c/bI2ivq7t/123-health-scanner body parts and perform https://trello.com/c/zCaEMsZT/95-tweezers surgery to remove https://trello.com/c/fZxELUz8/120-foreign-bodies as well as heal https://trello.com/c/WXqMZijc/156-internal-damage and blunt force trauma
13. https://trello.com/c/LwhWr6ge/96-organ-transplant-surgery surgery if needed.
14. Apply https://trello.com/c/EIxAXxJq/72-sutures to close surgeries & to fix https://trello.com/c/i23isLFt/110-wounds
15. https://trello.com/c/Jpb5HdHV/117-bandages then https://trello.com/c/POdNR4as/126-gypsum any https://trello.com/c/HKGh6Ixe/32-fractures on arms or legs to cast them
16. Use https://trello.com/c/Nx0hMjgY/131-hematology-analyzer to check if they have any lingering blood problems and administer https://trello.com/c/iJvfBEmr/143-broad-spectrum-antibiotics if they have https://trello.com/c/2xoQOFrV/29-sepsis if you didn't give it to them earlier

An additional option is https://trello.com/c/fque4kVs/142-liquid-oxygenite if they're having https://trello.com/c/KVxUVP33/48-neurotrauma and/or having massive bleeding problems. It negates all need for breathing, heartbeat, and having any blood for 30 seconds. LO2 gives you some time to fix https://trello.com/c/hVXaTXlX/71-arterial-bleeding or https://trello.com/c/CKxExfJX/124-aortic-rupture properly while not accruing damage for 30 seconds. It will cause some organ damage though.

You can also choose to use https://trello.com/c/fque4kVs/142-liquid-oxygenite to outright ignore bleeding, breathing, and heartbeat problems for 30 seconds while you do surgery, then apply https://trello.com/c/kmwykfmE/80-blood-packs and restart heartbeat/breathing after fixing problems with surgery. If they have an https://trello.com/c/CKxExfJX/124-aortic-rupture it might be a good idea to use LO2 and ignore the massive blood loss and replace the blood after fixing the aortic rupture and any other serious bleeding.
