If the patient is in immediate danger of dying put them in a [[Stasis Bag]]
A stasis bag will give you 6 minutes of paused afflictions to diagnose, figure out your treatment plan, and administer any treatments short of surgery.

### Suggested treatments in order of importance
1. Put them in [[Stasis Bag]] if they're in rapidly deteriorating condition
2. Diagnose problems and figure out which steps from below are relevant
3. [[Tourniquet]] any [[Arterial Bleeding]]
4. If there's major regular bleeding, [[Sutures|suture]] them, give [[Blood Packs]] if necessary and continue doing so in further steps if necessary. If they have internal or aortic bleeding, that will need to be fixed before transfusing blood or you will waste blood bags. Consider using liquid oxygenite further down to stabilize the patient for those surgeries.
5. Use a [[Needle]] if [[Pneumothorax]] is high
6. If in stasis bag, prep patient for removal from bag, give any drugs if they need it
\- [[Azathioprine]]: if they need later organ transplants
\- Antirad or stabilozine: radiation sickness **IMPORTANT**
\- [[Broad-spectrum Antibiotics]]: sepsis
\- [[Mannitol]]: neurotrama reduction or healing if their blood is stable
\- [[Morphine]]: painkiller for surgery
\- [[Thiamine]]: organ damage healing
Then take them out of the stasis bag to start surgery (here's where you apply [[Liquid Oxygenite]] if you're going to after using a stasis bag)
7. First aid for heartbeat/breathing if they're arrested or about to arrest (or if just taken out of stasis bag, as that arrests heartbeat and breathing). Skip this step if they have massive internal or aortic bleeding to fix first.
8. Fix [[Internal Bleeding]], and [[Arterial Bleeding]] properly. Give more blood if needed.
9. Properly fix any heart/breathing problems, including using [[Drainage]] to fix [[Pneumothorax]]
10. Fix bad [[Burns]] (high second degree or any third degree)
\- Second degree: [[Antibiotic Ointment]] or [[Bandages]] if that limb doesn't need surgery 
\- Third degree: [[Antibiotic Glue]], or if that limb needs surgery, wait till the end of surgery and use [[Plastiseal]] before the closing [[Sutures]].
11. Do [[Osteosynthesis Implants]] surgeries on head/neck/chest [[Fractures]] and then [[Spinal Cord Implants]] surgery on [[Spinal Cord Injury]]
12. [[Health Scanner|Health scan]] body parts and perform [[Tweezers]] surgery to remove [[Foreign Bodies]] as well as heal [internal damage](https://trello.com/c/WXqMZijc/156-internal-damage) and blunt force trauma
13. [[Organ Transplant Surgery]] surgery if needed.
14. Apply [[Sutures]] to close surgeries & to fix wounds
15. Use bandages and then [[Gypsum]] any fractures on arms or legs to cast them
16. Use [[Hematology Analyzer]] to check if they have any lingering blood problems and administer [[Broad-spectrum Antibiotics]] if they have [[Sepsis]] if you didn't give it to them earlier

An additional option is [[Liquid Oxygenite]] if they're having [[Neurotrauma]] and/or having massive bleeding problems. It negates all need for breathing, heartbeat, and having any blood for 30 seconds. LO2 gives you some time to fix [[Arterial Bleeding]] or [[Aortic Rupture]] properly while not accruing damage for 30 seconds. It will cause some organ damage though.

You can also choose to use liquid oxygenite to outright ignore bleeding, breathing, and heartbeat problems for 30 seconds while you do surgery, then apply [[Blood Packs]] and restart heartbeat/breathing after fixing problems with surgery. If they have an [[Aortic Rupture]] it might be a good idea to use LO2 and ignore the massive blood loss and replace the blood after fixing the aortic rupture and any other serious bleeding.
