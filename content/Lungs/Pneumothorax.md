Pneumothorax will prevent [Hypoxemia](../Blood/Hypoxemia.md) from decreasing in strength. While not lethal on its own, Pneumothorax can easily kill if paired with afflictions that cause Hypoxemia. Pneumothorax's negative effects can be temporarily negated by using a [Needle](../Items/Needle.md).

- [Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md) (rib fractures, if they arent bandaged)
- Trauma (gunshots, explosions, lacerations, bite wounds, blunt force, [[Internal Wounds#Internal damage|Internal Damage]]
- [Needle](../Items/Needle.md)

## Effects:

- [Shortness of Breath](../Symptoms/Shortness%20of%20Breath.md) (at 40% or more)
- [Hyperventilation](Hyperventilation.md) (at 15% or more)
- [Increased Heartrate](../Symptoms/Increased%20Heartrate.md) (at 30% or more)
- Prevents [Hypoxemia](../Blood/Hypoxemia.md) from decreasing in severity, proportional to the strength of the affliction

## Treatments:

- Using a [Drainage](../Items/Drainage.md) during surgery (After [Skin Retractors](../Items/Skin%20Retractors.md)
