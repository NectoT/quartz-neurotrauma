Anesthesia is an affliction that prevents traumatic shock during surgery, and unlike [Analgesia](Analgesia.md), doesn't require a [Surgery Table](../Items/Surgery%20Table.md) to perform safe surgery. Anesthesia will immediately wear off upon reaching 100% strength. Anesthesia will also slow your character down by 50%.
