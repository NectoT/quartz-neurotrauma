The fourth step in most surgical procedures. Having retracted skin without a [[Surgery Table](../Items/Surgery%20Table.md)]([Surgery Table](../Items/Surgery%20Table.md) "smartCard-inline")  nearby will cause 2% [[Traumatic Shock](Traumatic%20Shock.md)]([Traumatic Shock](Traumatic%20Shock.md) "smartCard-inline") per second for each instance of retracted skin. Most surgical procedures, such as [[Osteosynthetic Surgery](../Procedures/Osteosynthetic%20Surgery.md)]([Osteosynthetic Surgery](../Procedures/Osteosynthetic%20Surgery.md) "smartCard-inline") or [[Organ Transplant Surgery](../Procedures/Organ%20Transplant%20Surgery.md)]([Organ Transplant Surgery](../Procedures/Organ%20Transplant%20Surgery.md) "smartCard-inline") stem off from this step.
