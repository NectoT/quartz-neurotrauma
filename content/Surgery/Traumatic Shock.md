Traumatic shock can rapidly become fatal, and should your patient acquire this at any point, it is likely to be unintended. Traumatic shock will decrease in strength 4x as fast provided the victim is under the effects of [Anesthesia](../Torso/Anesthesia.md).

If a character has [Retracted Skin](Retracted%20Skin.md), the character will gain 5 minutes of traumatic shock immunity on the next round.

### Caused by:

- Performing unsafe surgery:
  - [Surgery Incision](Surgery%20Incision.md)
  - Any other surgical step after Clamped Bleeders without sedation, such as being near a [Surgery Table](../Items/Surgery%20Table.md).
- Using [Tweezers](../Items/Tweezers.md)

## Effects:

- [Hypotension](../Blood/Hypotension.md)
- [Cardiac Arrest](../Heart/Cardiac%20Arrest.md)
- [Respiratory Arrest](../Lungs/Respiratory%20Arrest.md)
- [Neurotrauma](../Head_Brain/Neurotrauma.md)
- Psychosis (equal to strength divided by 100 per second)

## Treatments:

- Terminating the surgery and waiting
- Bringing into proximity of a [Surgery Table](../Items/Surgery%20Table.md) and making sure the patient is sedated

## Prevention:

- Making sure that the surgery is safe before proceeding beyond the [Retracted Skin](Retracted%20Skin.md) step
- Making sure [Analgesia](../Torso/Analgesia.md) or other forms of sedation donâ€™t run out in the middle of surgery
