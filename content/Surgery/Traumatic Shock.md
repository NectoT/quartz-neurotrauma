Traumatic shock can rapidly become fatal, and should your patient acquire this at any point, it is likely to be unintended. Traumatic shock will decrease in strength 4x as fast provided the victim is under the effects of [Anesthesia](../Torso/Anesthesia.md), or has [Analgesia](../Torso/Analgesia.md) while being near a [Surgery Table](../Items/Surgery%20Table.md).

If a character has [Retracted Skin](Retracted%20Skin.md) and the round ends (such as on docking to a station), the character will gain 5 minutes of traumatic shock immunity on the next round.

### Caused by:

- Performing unsafe surgery:
  - [Surgery Incision](Surgery%20Incision.md) without [Analgesia](../Torso/Analgesia.md)
  - Any other surgical step after Clamped Bleeders without sedation, such as being near a [Surgery Table](../Items/Surgery%20Table.md) or having [Anesthesia](../Torso/Anesthesia.md).
- Using [Tweezers](../Items/Tweezers.md)  through gunshot wounds or deep tissue injuries (causes minor shock unless overused)

## Effects:

- [Hypotension](../Blood/Hypotension.md)  (and lots of it)
- [Cardiac Arrest](../Heart/Cardiac%20Arrest.md)  (at 40% or more)
- [Respiratory Arrest](../Lungs/Respiratory%20Arrest.md)  (at 30% or more)
- [Neurotrauma](../Head_Brain/Neurotrauma.md)  (equal to strength divided by 100 per second, 10% or more is the point at which it outpaces natural regeneration)
- Psychosis (equal to strength divided by 100 per second)

## Treatments:

- Terminating the surgery and waiting
- Bringing into proximity of a [Surgery Table](../Items/Surgery%20Table.md) and making sure the patient is sedated

## Prevention:

- Making sure that the surgery is safe before proceeding beyond the [Retracted Skin](Retracted%20Skin.md) step
- Making sure [Analgesia](../Torso/Analgesia.md) or other forms of sedation donâ€™t run out in the middle of surgery
