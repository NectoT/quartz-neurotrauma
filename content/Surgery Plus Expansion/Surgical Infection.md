Surgical Infection is a mechanic that causes [Sepsis](../Blood/Sepsis.md) based on how sterile the patient's environment is.

---

The following will _increase_ sterility:

- Patient wearing [Surgical Drapes](Surgical%20Drapes.md) (+100 base sterility)
- Nearby characters wearing [Surgical Mask](Surgical%20Mask.md) and [Surgeon Clothes](Surgeon%20Clothes.md) (scales with distance to patient)
- Having surgery skill (sterility gained based off this equation: 10 + surgery skill / 5)
- Having [Ointmented](../Any%20bodypart/Ointmented.md) on the incision (+50 sterility)

---

The following will _decrease_ sterility:

- Patient having no [Surgical Drapes](Surgical%20Drapes.md) or [Ointmented](../Any%20bodypart/Ointmented.md) (sets sterility to the minimum)
- Nearby characters not wearing [Surgical Mask](Surgical%20Mask.md) or [Surgeon Clothes](Surgeon%20Clothes.md) (scales with distance to patient)

---

At the minimum sterility, there is a 10% chance every two seconds for the patient to acquire [Sepsis](../Blood/Sepsis.md).
