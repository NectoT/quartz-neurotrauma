Surgical Infection is a mechanic that causes [[Sepsis](../Blood/Sepsis.md)]([Sepsis](../Blood/Sepsis.md) "smartCard-inline") based on how sterile the patient's environment is.

---

The following will _increase_ sterility:

- Patient wearing [[Surgical Drapes](Surgical%20Drapes.md)]([Surgical Drapes](Surgical%20Drapes.md) "smartCard-inline") (+100 base sterility)
- Nearby characters wearing [[Surgical Mask](Surgical%20Mask.md)]([Surgical Mask](Surgical%20Mask.md) "smartCard-inline") and [[Surgeon Clothes](Surgeon%20Clothes.md)]([Surgeon Clothes](Surgeon%20Clothes.md) "smartCard-inline") (scales with distance to patient)
- Having surgery skill (sterility gained based off this equation: 10 + surgery skill / 5)
- Having [[Ointmented](../Any%20bodypart/Ointmented.md)]([Ointmented](../Any%20bodypart/Ointmented.md) "smartCard-inline") on the incision (+50 sterility)

---

The following will _decrease_ sterility:

- Patient having no [[Surgical Drapes](Surgical%20Drapes.md)]([Surgical Drapes](Surgical%20Drapes.md) "smartCard-inline") or [[Ointmented](../Any%20bodypart/Ointmented.md)]([Ointmented](../Any%20bodypart/Ointmented.md) "smartCard-inline") (sets sterility to the minimum)
- Nearby characters not wearing [[Surgical Mask](Surgical%20Mask.md)]([Surgical Mask](Surgical%20Mask.md) "smartCard-inline") or [[Surgeon Clothes](Surgeon%20Clothes.md)]([Surgeon Clothes](Surgeon%20Clothes.md) "smartCard-inline") (scales with distance to patient)

---

At the minimum sterility, there is a 10% chance every two seconds for the patient to acquire [[Sepsis](../Blood/Sepsis.md)]([Sepsis](../Blood/Sepsis.md) "smartCard-inline").
