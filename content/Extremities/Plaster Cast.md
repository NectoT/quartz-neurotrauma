Plaster casts are extremely important for treating limb [Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md). Assuming the config is unchanged, getting a fracture on a limb that is already casted will break the cast. Plaster casts can be removed with [Trauma Shears](../Items/Trauma%20Shears.md) .

## Caused by:

- Applying [Gypsum](../Items/Gypsum.md) to a limb with [Bandaged](../Any%20bodypart/Bandaged.md)

## Effects:

- Slowly treats limb [Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md) by 0.33% per second
- Slows you down by 20% for each cast
