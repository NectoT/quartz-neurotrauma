# Plaster Cast

Original URL: https://trello.com/c/lZCWqJbI

---

Plaster casts are extremely important for treating limb [[Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md)]([Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md) "smartCard-inline"). Assuming the config is unchanged, getting a fracture on a limb that is already casted will break the cast. Plaster casts can be removed with [[Trauma Shears](../Items/Trauma%20Shears.md)]([Trauma Shears](../Items/Trauma%20Shears.md) "smartCard-inline") .

## Caused by:

- Applying [[Gypsum](../Items/Gypsum.md)]([Gypsum](../Items/Gypsum.md) "smartCard-inline") to a limb with [[Bandaged](../Any%20bodypart/Bandaged.md)]([Bandaged](../Any%20bodypart/Bandaged.md) "smartCard-inline")

## Effects:

- Slowly treats limb [[Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md)]([Fractures](../Bones/Fractures.md) "smartCard-inline") by 0.33% per second
- Slows you down by 20% for each cast
