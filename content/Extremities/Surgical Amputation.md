Surgical amputation is the amputation of an extremity. Possible amputations include arms, legs, and the head. The head cannot be reattached after amputation. Unlike traumatic amputations, surgical amputations will not cause [[Arterial Bleeding](Arterial%20Bleeding.md)]([Arterial Bleeding](Arterial%20Bleeding.md) "smartCard-inline") upon first acquiring them.

## Caused by:

## Effects:

### In leg amputations:

- 1 leg amputation will halve speed

- 2 arm amputations will prevent you from interacting with anything, such as doors, ladders, buttons, etc.
