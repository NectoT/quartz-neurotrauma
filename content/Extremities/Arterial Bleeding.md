Arterial ruptures are extremely dangerous and require emergency care as soon as possible. Applying a [Tourniquet](../Items/Tourniquet.md) to the afflicted limb can buy you time to treat it, but this should not be done on the head. The arteries which may rupture include the carotid artery on the head, brachial arteries of the arms, and femoral arteries of the legs. Rupture of the torso artery is an [Aortic Rupture](../Torso/Aortic%20Rupture.md).
