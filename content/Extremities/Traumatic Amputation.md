Traumatic amputation is the non-surgical amputation of an extremity. A traumatic amputation will act the exact same as a [[Surgical Amputation](Surgical%20Amputation.md)]([Surgical Amputation](Surgical%20Amputation.md) "smartCard-inline") , besides from the fact that you will acquire [[Arterial Bleeding](Arterial%20Bleeding.md)]([Arterial Bleeding](Arterial%20Bleeding.md) "smartCard-inline") upon first getting amputated. A limb must be fractured in order to become traumatically amputated.
