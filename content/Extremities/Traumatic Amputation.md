Traumatic amputation is the non-surgical amputation of an extremity. A traumatic amputation will act the exact same as a [Surgical Amputation](Surgical%20Amputation.md) , besides from the fact that you will acquire [Arterial Bleeding](Arterial%20Bleeding.md) upon first getting amputated. A limb must be fractured in order to become traumatically amputated.
