A cybernetic kidney replacement. Embrace the certainty of steel!

Available as a more affordable Cyber-augmented Kidney (half meat, half silicon) crafted from an extracted Kidney, or the twice as effective fully-synthetic Cyberkidney.

### Advantages of Cyberkidneys:

- With the power of techology, you only need one!
- Resistance to [Blood Loss](../Blood/Blood%20Loss.md)
- Switches blood type to C+, which can accept any other blood without [Hemotransfusion Shock](../Blood/Hemotransfusion%20Shock.md)
- Resistance to [Kidney Damage](../Torso/Kidney%20Damage.md)

#### Disadvantages of Cyberorgans:

- Switches blood type to C+, whose cybernanites will cause [Hemotransfusion Shock](../Blood/Hemotransfusion%20Shock.md) if given to anyone else lacking cybernetic blood.
- Can periodically experience fits of Cyberpsychosis (regular psychosis), which can be avoided by reducing your Immunity in any way, such as the very affordable Immunosuppressant Inhaler.

## How to add:

Do [Organ Transplant Surgery](../Procedures/Organ%20Transplant%20Surgery.md), using the Cyberkidney instead of a pair of feeble meat kidneys. Consider refrigerating the procured meat for upgrading into a Cyber-augmented Kidney.

#### Mechanical skill requirement: 60

Medical/Surgical skill requirement: 70

#### Application Success:

Installs the cyberorgan, healing that organâ€™s damage and some [Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md) .

#### Application Failure (Mechanical):

Same as Success but causes 20% [Kidney Damage](../Torso/Kidney%20Damage.md)    .

#### Application Failure (Medical):

Same as Success but causes [Internal Bleeding](../Torso/Internal%20Bleeding.md).

## How to remove:

[Organ Transplant Surgery](../Procedures/Organ%20Transplant%20Surgery.md) will remove and return the corresponding cybernetic organ.
