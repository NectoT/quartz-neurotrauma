A cybernetic kidney replacement. Embrace the certainty of steel!

Available as a more affordable Cyber-augmented Kidney (half meat, half silicon) crafted from an extracted Kidney, or the twice as effective fully-synthetic Cyberkidney.

### Advantages of Cyberkidneys:

- With the power of techology, you only need one!
- Resistance to [[Blood Loss](../Blood/Blood%20Loss.md)]([Blood Loss](../Blood/Blood%20Loss.md) "smartCard-inline")  and [[Bleeding](../Any%20bodypart/Bleeding.md)]([Bleeding](../Any%20bodypart/Bleeding.md) "smartCard-inline")
- Switches blood type to C+, which can accept any other blood without [[Hemotransfusion Shock](../Blood/Hemotransfusion%20Shock.md)]([Hemotransfusion Shock](../Blood/Hemotransfusion%20Shock.md) "smartCard-inline")
- Resistance to [[Kidney Damage](../Torso/Kidney%20Damage.md)]([Kidney Damage](../Torso/Kidney%20Damage.md) "smartCard-inline")

#### Disadvantages of Cyberorgans:

- Switches blood type to C+, whose cybernanites will cause [[Hemotransfusion Shock](../Blood/Hemotransfusion%20Shock.md)]([Hemotransfusion Shock](../Blood/Hemotransfusion%20Shock.md) "smartCard-inline") if given to anyone else lacking cybernetic blood.
- Can periodically experience fits of Cyberpsychosis (regular psychosis), which can be avoided by reducing your Immunity in any way, such as the very affordable Immunosuppressant Inhaler.

## How to add:

Do [[Organ Transplant Surgery](../Procedures/Organ%20Transplant%20Surgery.md)]([Organ Transplant Surgery](../Procedures/Organ%20Transplant%20Surgery.md) "smartCard-inline"), using the Cyberkidney instead of a pair of feeble meat kidneys. Consider refrigerating the procured meat for upgrading into a Cyber-augmented Kidney.

#### Mechanical skill requirement: 60

Medical/Surgical skill requirement: 70

#### Application Success:

Installs the cyberorgan, healing that organâ€™s damage and some [[Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md)]([Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md) "smartCard-inline") .

#### Application Failure (Mechanical):

Same as Success but causes 20% [[Kidney Damage](../Torso/Kidney%20Damage.md)]([Kidney Damage](../Torso/Kidney%20Damage.md) "smartCard-inline")    .

#### Application Failure (Medical):

Same as Success but causes [[Internal Bleeding](../Torso/Internal%20Bleeding.md)]([Internal Bleeding](../Torso/Internal%20Bleeding.md) "smartCard-inline").

## How to remove:

[[Organ Transplant Surgery](../Procedures/Organ%20Transplant%20Surgery.md)]([Organ Transplant Surgery](../Procedures/Organ%20Transplant%20Surgery.md) "smartCard-inline") will remove and return the corresponding cybernetic organ.
