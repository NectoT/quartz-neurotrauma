A cybernetic brain booster. Embrace the certainty of steel!

Available as a more affordable Cyber-augmented Brain Implant, or the twice as effective top-of-the-line ‘Cyberbrain’ Positronic Implant.

### Advantages of Cyberbrain Implants:

- Boosts all skills by 5 (10 for Positronic)
- Grants permanent mild [Analgesia](../Torso/Analgesia.md)  for easier surgeries
- Improves [Neurotrauma](../Head_Brain/Neurotrauma.md)  recovery rate
  - Doubles effects of [Mannitol](../Items/Mannitol.md)
  - Doubles natural healing rate once causes are addressed
- Mild resistance to [Neurotrauma](../Head_Brain/Neurotrauma.md)

#### Disadvantages of Cyberorgans:

- Can periodically experience fits of Cyberpsychosis (regular psychosis), which can be avoided by reducing your Immunity in any way, such as the very affordable Immunosuppressant Inhaler.

## How to add:

Open up the head as a typical surgery with[Retracted Skin](../Surgery/Retracted%20Skin.md), but do not remove their brain! They’ll still need to keep that! Instead, place the Implant on top.

#### Electrical skill requirement: 60

Medical/Surgical skill requirement: 80

#### Application Success:

Installs the implant, healing some [Neurotrauma](../Head_Brain/Neurotrauma.md)  and some [Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md) .

#### Application Failure (Mechanical):

Same as Success but causes 20% [Neurotrauma](../Head_Brain/Neurotrauma.md).

#### Application Failure (Medical):

Same as Success but causes [Internal Bleeding](../Torso/Internal%20Bleeding.md).

## How to remove:

[Organ Transplant Surgery](../Procedures/Organ%20Transplant%20Surgery.md) _once_ will return the Implant, using the [Organ Procurement Scalpels](../Items/archived/Organ%20Procurement%20Scalpels.md) a second time will remove the patient’s brain, which they probably need.
