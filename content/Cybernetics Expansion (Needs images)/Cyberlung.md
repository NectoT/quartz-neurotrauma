A cybernetic lung replacement. Embrace the certainty of steel!

Available as a more affordable Cyber-augmented Lung (half meat, half silicon) crafted from an extracted Lung, or the twice as effective fully-synthetic Cyberlung.

### Advantages of Cyberlungs:

- Partial Pressure Protection: briefly grants protection every 30 seconds, functionally doubling the non-lethal time spent in pressure without a suit
- Improves melee attack speed and movement speed.
- Resistant to [Lung Damage](../Lungs/Lung%20Damage.md) & [Pneumothorax](../Lungs/Pneumothorax.md)

#### Disadvantages of Cyberorgans:

- Can periodically experience fits of Cyberpsychosis (regular psychosis), which can be avoided by reducing your [Immunity](../Blood/Immunity.md) in any way, such as the very affordable Immunosuppressant Inhaler.

## How to add:

Do [Organ Transplant Surgery](../Procedures/Organ%20Transplant%20Surgery.md), using the Cyberlung instead of a feeble meat lung. Consider refrigerating the procured meat for upgrading into a Cyber-augmented Lung.

#### Mechanical skill requirement: 60

Medical/Surgical skill requirement: 70

#### Application Success:

Installs the cyberorgan, healing that organâ€™s damage and some [Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md) .

#### Application Failure (Mechanical):

Same as Success but causes 20% [Lung Damage](../Lungs/Lung%20Damage.md)  .

#### Application Failure (Medical):

Same as Success but causes [Internal Bleeding](../Torso/Internal%20Bleeding.md).

## How to remove:

[Organ Transplant Surgery](../Procedures/Organ%20Transplant%20Surgery.md) will remove and return the corresponding cybernetic organ.
