---

A cybernetic arm that can be attached to any surgically amputated arm socket. Can be removed with a  [[Crowbar](Crowbar.md)]([Crowbar](Crowbar.md) "smartCard-inline").

### Advantages of cyberlimbs:

- Improves melee attack speed and swim speed.
- Great at taking sustained gunfire without malfunctioning.
- Excellent at tanking attacks from creatures without malfunctioning or breaking.
- Ideal at sustaining attacks that would otherwise cause life-threatening bleeding.
- When well maintained, is much less likely to be forcefully amputated when attacked.
- Does not fracture or dislocate. Make sure you fix any dislocations or fractures BEFORE you add a cyber limb or else it will be permanent until you take off the limb.

#### Disadvantages of cyberlimbs:

- They do not mix well with water. Won’t shock you, but will break  overtime if you don’t wear a suit.
  - The expensive Waterproof Cyberarm upgraded item prevents this, and otherwise has identical characteristics.
- Requires maintenance if damaged.
- Costly maintenance, especially if your sub doesn’t have an ample source of steel and FPGA circuits.
- Costly/expensive to make/buy.
- Violently detach if critically damaged through material loss.

## How to add:

First do [Amputation Surgery]([Amputation Surgery](../Procedures/Amputation%20Surgery.md) "‌") on the selected limb, then use the cyberlimb on the chosen limb.

#### Mechanical skill requirement: 70

#### Application Success:

Applies the cyberlimb on the selected limb and heals any internal damage caused by any previous failed attempts.

#### Application Failure:

Applies 20% [Internal Damage]([Internal Damage](../Any%20bodypart/archived/Internal%20Damage.md) "‌") on the limb. Does not delete the cyberlimb.
