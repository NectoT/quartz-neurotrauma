# Damaged Electronics

The primary detriment of using cyberlimbs, as their electronics are damaged when exposed to water.

When taking damage to a cyberlimb, each type of damage has a chance to cause various types and amounts of cyberlimb specific damage instead of the normal damage type.

The amount of damaged electronics gained scales with the amount of [[Material Loss](Material%20Loss.md)]([Material Loss](Material%20Loss.md) "smartCard-inline") , up to a maximum of x3 at 100% material loss)

## Caused by:

- Being in water without a diving suit on
- 75% chance for [[Burns](../Any%20bodypart/Burns.md)]([Burns](../Any%20bodypart/Burns.md) "smartCard-inline")  to cause 200% of their damage as damaged electronics
- 85% chance for gunshot wounds to cause 75% of their damage as damaged electronics
- 50% chance for bite wounds to cause 25% of their damage as damaged electronics
- 50% chance for deep tissue damage to cause 50% of its damage as damaged electronics
- 50% chance for blunt force trauma to cause 100% of its damage as damaged electronics
- 75% chance for [[Internal Damage](../Any%20bodypart/archived/Internal%20Damage.md)]([Internal Damage](../Any%20bodypart/archived/Internal%20Damage.md) "smartCard-inline")  to cause 100% of its damage as damaged electronics
- 75% chance for [[Foreign Bodies](../Any%20bodypart/Foreign%20Bodies.md)]([Foreign Bodies](../Any%20bodypart/Foreign%20Bodies.md) "smartCard-inline")  to cause 75% of its damage as damaged electronics

## Effects:

- Limb occassionally stops working temporarily, frequency scales with strength
- Limb becomes unusable (at 99% or more)

## Treatments:

- [[FPGA Circuit](FPGA%20Circuit.md)]([FPGA Circuit](FPGA%20Circuit.md) "smartCard-inline")
