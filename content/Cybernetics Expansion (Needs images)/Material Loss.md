The amount of material loss gained scales with the amount of [[Loose Screws](Loose%20Screws.md)]([Loose Screws](Loose%20Screws.md) "smartCard-inline") , to a maximum of x3 at 100% loose screws)

## Caused by:

- [[Loose Screws](Loose%20Screws.md)]([Loose Screws](Loose%20Screws.md) "smartCard-inline")  while moving (30% or more)
