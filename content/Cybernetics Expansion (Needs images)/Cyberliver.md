A cybernetic liver replacement. Embrace the certainty of steel!

Available as a more affordable Cyber-augmented Liver (half meat, half silicon) crafted from an extracted Liver, or the twice as effective fully-synthetic Cyberliver.

### Advantages of Cyberlivers:

- Resistant to poisons, toxins, and [Nausea](../Symptoms/Nausea.md)
- Resistant to [Liver Damage](../Torso/Liver%20Damage.md)

#### Disadvantages of Cyberorgans:

- Can periodically experience fits of Cyberpsychosis (regular psychosis), which can be avoided by reducing your Immunity in any way, such as the very affordable Immunosuppressant Inhaler.

## How to add:

Do [Organ Transplant Surgery](../Procedures/Organ%20Transplant%20Surgery.md), using the Cyberliver instead of a feeble meat liver. Consider refrigerating the procured meat for upgrading into a Cyber-augmented Liver.

#### Mechanical skill requirement: 60

Medical/Surgical skill requirement: 70

#### Application Success:

Installs the cyberorgan, healing that organâ€™s damage and some [Vanilla Organ Damage](../Torso/Vanilla%20Organ%20Damage.md) .

#### Application Failure (Mechanical):

Same as Success but causes 20% [Liver Damage](../Torso/Liver%20Damage.md)   .

#### Application Failure (Medical):

Same as Success but causes [Internal Bleeding](../Torso/Internal%20Bleeding.md).

## How to remove:

[Organ Transplant Surgery](../Procedures/Organ%20Transplant%20Surgery.md) will remove and return the corresponding cybernetic organ.
